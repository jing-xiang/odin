    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, cook ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add onion and garlic; cook until onion is tender. Drain off fat.</li>
      <li>Add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese with 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>To assemble, spread 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 cup meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
